# Application data recovery from the archives
#
# Retrieval of 'safe password files' for application data archives to restore
#
# service_platform_ansible/roles/app_data_restore_1
#
# Give the application data archive label in 'app_db'.
#
# The point in time 'before' is expressed in UTC, ISO 8601 date (and time)
# at the precision of a calendar month, day, hour or minute. A lower precision
# timestamp will be interpreted by finding the last available restore point
# within the given range. An exact match is included, so the precise meaning
# is 'at or before'.
#
# The 'client' hostname is given in the fully-qualified form (FQDN).
#
# As a double entry safety mechanism, the 'prefix' must be set to match the
# above values with: "{{ app_db }}_{{ client }}_{{ before }}"
#
# The system will automatically replace the prefix with the completion status
# after the data has been restored. If the same operation needs to be repeated,
# the service administrator must manually reset the prefix.
#
# Commit and sign the configuration changes with the service administrator's
# GPG key. This makes a permanent record of the operation in the service main
# CMDB. You can safely remove old entries, which have been previously committed.
# The revision control keeps the history.
